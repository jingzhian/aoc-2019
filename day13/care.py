## A New Game

# Arcade Cabinet runs Intcode software - the input
# - Primitive screen capable of drawing square tiles on a grid
# - Software draws tiles to the screen with output instructions
# - Every three output instructions specify the x position (from left), y position (from top), and tile id

# Tile ID
# 0 is a empty tile: no game object
# 1 is a wall tile: indestructible barriers
# 2 is a block tile: broken by ball
# 3 is a horizontal paddle: indestructible
# 4 is a ball tile: move diagonally and bounces off objects
